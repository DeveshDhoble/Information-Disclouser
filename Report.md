Depending on the context, websites may leak all kinds of information to a potential attacker, including: Data about other users, such as usernames or financial information.

Severity: Medium

Impact : Information disclosure vulnerabilities can have both a direct and indirect impact depending on the purpose of the website and, therefore, what information an attacker is able to obtain. In some cases, the act of disclosing sensitive information alone can have a high impact on the affected parties. For example, an online shop leaking its customers' credit card details is likely to have severe consequences.
